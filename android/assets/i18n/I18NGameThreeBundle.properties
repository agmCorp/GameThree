helpOne.talePartOne=\n   {{WAIT=2.0}{{SPEED=0.5}A long time ago, the Mochizuki clan was attacked by four indescribable monsters and their evil army.\
  \n\n   To stop the invaders, Sensei Mochizuki joined forces with the Queen of the Forest, the Sorceress Marlena. \
  \n\n   {{WAIT=0.5}Combining the most powerful spells with the secrets of the ancestral martial arts, the monsters were defeated and the \
  whole army was seized and locked in cages in deep underground dungeons. \
  \n\n   As the years passed, friendship between Mochizuki and Marlena blossomed into romance and a baby boy named Drako \
  was born as the fruit and bond of their marriage..
helpOne.talePartTwo=  \n\n   {{SPEED=0.5}Anticipating the worst, both parents trained their son in all \
  manner of combat and sorcery skills.\

  \n\n   His mission is to travel around the four worlds to destroy this army and its commanders.\
  \n\n   Throughout this dangerous adventure, he will be able to pick up different items left there by Mochizuki and \
  Marlena to help him. \
